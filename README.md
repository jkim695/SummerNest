# SummerNest

# App.js 

Contains all of the pathing for each of webpages.

# HomePage.js

Supported by HomePage.css, it contains the homepage. Has a description of how to use the webpage.

In the future, we should get rid of this search feature and instead have a better
UI that tells the user how to use our website.

# BrowseListings.js

Supported by BrowseListings.css, it contains the search feature and the featured
listings. 

In the future, it should be able to dynamically handle the input of the search 
and have a section that says filtered results or something similar. 

# ListYourSpace.js

Supported by ListYourSpace.css, it contains a form that allows the user to input 
the necessary information for their lease. Right now, it displays all that 
information into the console. 

In the future, we should work with the backend to send that data to a database.
We should also look into researching how to have the display be different depending
on the username/password. Also dynamic updating so that it immediately gets
put onto the BrowseListings.js page.

# Login.js

Supported by Login.css, it contains a sample login screen. In the future, it will
be connected with the back end.

# Signup.js

Supported by Signup.css, it contains a sample signup screen. In the future, it will 
be connected with the back end
